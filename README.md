# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Built using `npx create-react-app spotify-clone`

## Download Yarn 

`Yarn` dependencies are used within this project. You can download `yarn` using the following:
`npm install --global yarn`. You can follow up by checking which version of yarn you have just downloaded using `yarn --version`

Add the yarn dependencies using `yarn add styled-components react-icons axios`

## Start React Project

As we have added yarn dependencies, we will use `yarn start` not `npm start` to run the project.
